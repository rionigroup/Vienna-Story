    intro: `
    The Arany Spa is located in the former vault of a bank building, which is now home to the luxurious Park Hyatt Vienna hotel in the heart of Vienna. Where once gold and banknotes were stored, an oasis of calm invites one to relax and recharge ones batteries.
    The former vault was converted into an exceptional spa area with pool and fitness room on 1000m2. As a reminder of the splendid time, the 3-ton safe door was left in its place.
    Come and enjoy the Spa, which offers many ways to indulge and take a break from a visit to the bustling city.
