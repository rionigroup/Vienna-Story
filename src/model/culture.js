    intro: `
    Going to a concert here is about getting to know Vienna as a city of music in a setting of the very finest quality. The Musikverein is adored by music lovers from around the globe and is the home of the Vienna Philharmonic orchestra. Its spectacular concert hall – the Great Hall – is considered to be one of the finest in the world, also thanks to it superb acoustics. Every year the famous New Year’s concerts in performed in this very same hall.
    The building was designed by Theophil Hansen. 
    Having studied in Athens, he became a exponent of “Greek Revival”, a style which is evident in almost every aspect of the Musikverein’s design. Greek reflections can be seen in the caryatids of the Great Hall and in the columns and the temple roof of the Brahms Saal. All these features together create a wonderfully classical ambience for spectacular performances.
