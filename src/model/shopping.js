    intro: `
    Schullin is a family business lead in the third generation. Excelling competence in high-end jewellery design and manufacturing are their key focus. 
    <p><br></P>
    From an initial inspiration to the finished piece, the creation-process involves the client very closely in order to match his or her personal expectations. There is no other material enlivening the intensity of colours the way gemstones do. The magic has always fascinated the Schullin family and lead to a longstanding experience in the assessment of crystal colour spectrum. 
    <p><br></P>
    Every precious crafted stone of a Schullin piece was handpicked and most times even sourced by a family member at markets and miners across the world. Your unique and bespoke jewellery would definitely be found here.
