    The Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna is the oldest existing zoo in the world, opened in 1752. It is part of a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site with the imperial summer residence of Schönbrunn at its center. Here you’ll find and interesting architectural mix, with original buildings from the Baroque era mingling with modern zoo architecture.
    The Zoo is considered one of the best and most modern ones in the world, providing a unique blend of culture and nature, while promoting conservation and biodiversity. One may marvel at more than 700 species – some highly endangered – from Siberian tigers, pandas and hippos to one-horned rhinoceroses. Other highlights include a Koala House, the aquarium and the “Polarium” with ice bears.
    A visit to Schönbrunn is one of the favorite activities for families living in Vienna and for their children to enjoy the Orang.erie – home of the orang-utans and the Rainforest House.
