    intro: `
    Schloss Schönbrunn is one of the city’s most famous and impressive buildings. For more than 300 years, it was the summer residence of the Habsburgs. 
    <p><br></p>
    Built by the important architects, Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and Nicolaus Pacassi, together with its extensive gardens it forms an extraordinary, baroque building complex. The main part of the palace is 175 metres wide and has 1441 rooms. The extensive park has a mixture of gardens, parkland, fountains, statues and monuments along with its own zoo and maze.
    <p><br></p>
    Only a fraction of the rooms are open to the public, but it’s enough to get an impression of the grand interior, with its Rococco-style decoration. Every surface is covered with a combination of decorative gold leaf, painted frescoes, white enamel and crystal chandeliers.
