    intro: `
    Schloss Schönbrunn one of the city’s most famous and impressive buildings. For more than 300 years, Schönbrunn was the summer residence of the Habsburgs. Built by the important architects Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and Nicolaus Pacassi, together with its extensive gardens it forms an extraordinary, baroque building complex. 
    The main part of the palace is 175 metres wide and has 1441 rooms. The extensive park covers 435 acres with a mixture of formal gardens, a large area of parkland, impressive fountains, statues and monuments along with its own zoo and maze.
    Only a fraction of the rooms are open to the public, but it’s enough to get an impression of the grand interior, with its Rococco-style decoration. Every surface is covered with a combination of decorative gold leaf, painted frescoes, white enamel and crystal chandeliers.`,
