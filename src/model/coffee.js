    intro: `
    The Vienna café culture forms such an integral part of what it means to be Viennese that UNESCO put it on the intangible cultural heritage list, describing it as a place ‘where time and space are consumed, but only the coffee is found on the bill’.
    The most grand of all Viennese Coffee houses is Café Central, opened in 1876. With its impressive polished stone columns and high vaulted ceiling it is the most beautiful one. During the 19th century it became a meeting place for the intellectual crowd of Vienna. Renowned figures like Sigmund Freud, Leon Trotsky and Adolf Loos were frequent patrons. After more than 140 years of history, it is still a center of Austrian culinary tradition, literature, philosophy and culture.
    Come and enjoy Austrian culinary classics and one of the desserts from the beautiful cake display, where each one looks like a piece of art.
