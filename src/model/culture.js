    intro: `
    Going to a concert here is about knowing Vienna as a city of music in a setting of the finest quality. Musikverein is adored by music lovers and is the home of the Vienna Philharmonic orchestra. 
    <p><br></p>
    Its spectacular concert hall – the Great Hall – is considered to be one of the finest in the world. All New Year’s concerts are performed in this very same hall. It was designed by Theophil Hansen, an exponent of “Greek Revival”, a style in every aspect of the Musikverein’s design. Greek reflections can be seen in the caryatids of the Great Hall, the columns and the temple roof of the Brahms Saal. All these features together create a wonderfully classical ambience for spectacular performances.
