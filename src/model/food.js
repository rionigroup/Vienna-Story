    intro: `
    Two award-winning sommeliers and a three-toque chef – perhaps the most exciting cuvée. The MAST Wine Bistro is a contemporary wine bistro with a focus on natural wines and regional cuisine with seasonal specialties. It was established by Matthias Pitra and Steve Breitzke – both sommelier of the year 2016 – whose first two letters make up the name of their restaurant.
    Both know what they’re doing and it's a pleasure to benefit from their expertise.  The wine list includes over 300 listings and an impressive range of wines by the glass. You can look forward to exciting wines full of life and naturalness. They primarily rely on smaller, local producers from Austria and other countries. 
    Thanks to its opening times, the MAST is the perfect place to end the week. The doors are open from Wednesday to Sunday.
