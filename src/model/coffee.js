    intro: `
    Vienna café Central is what it means to be Viennese. UNESCO included it on the intangible cultural heritage list, as a place ‘where time and space are consumed, but only the coffee is found on the bill’. 
    <p><br></p>
    With its impressive polished stone columns and high vaulted ceiling, Café Central has always been the most grand of all Viennese Coffee houses since 1876. During the 19th century it was a meeting place for the intellectual crowd of Vienna. Renowned figures like Sigmund Freud, Leon Trotsky and Adolf Loos were frequent patrons. 
    <p><br></p>
    With 140 years of history, it is still a center of Austrian culinary tradition, literature, philosophy and culture. Come and enjoy Austrian culinary classics and one of the desserts from the beautiful cake display, where each one looks like a piece of art!
