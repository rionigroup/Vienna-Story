    intro: `
    Schullin is a family business lead in the third generation. Excelling competence in high-end jewellery design and manufacturing are their key focus. From an initial inspiration to the finished piece, the creation-process involves the client very closely in order to match his or her personal expectations. 
    There is no other material enlivening the intensity of colours the way gemstones do. Their magic has always fascinated the Schullin family and lead to a longstanding experience in the assessment of nuances within the colour spectrum of crystals.
    Every precious stone used for crafting of a Schullin piece was handpicked and most times even sourced by a family member personally at markets and miners across the world. Working with precious and rare gemstones is equally a gift and a responsibility to the business; the challenge of setting a unique stone into a bespoke piece of jewellery makes this line of work truly fascinating.
